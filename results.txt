Time and Space Complexity:

Dijkstra:
  - Time: O(V + E log V)
  - Space: O(V)

A* Search:
  - Time: O(V log V) (depends on heuristic accuracy)
  - Space: O(V)

Greedy Best-First Search:
  - Time: O(V log V)
  - Space: O(V)
  - Note: Does not guarantee optimal solution (coin total may be higher).

V = Total number of accessible (non-wall) cells in the maze.
E = Total number of possible valid movements between cells. Each cell can have up to 8 connections (including diagonal directions).
